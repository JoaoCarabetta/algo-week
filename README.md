# Algorithm Week

The ideia is to select the key algorithms that any that data scientist should know and compile information, experiences and knowleadge about them.

If we do it collectively, one per week, we can build a nice database about these algorithms. 

I looked around in the search for some key algorithms. These are the ones that I found, but I am sure that there are more (wikipedia has a huge list [3]). Let's try to prioritise them [1, 2] :

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- K-Means
- Random Forest
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
- Gradient Boost & Adaboost
- Ridge
- K-neighbours
- Lasso
- Xgboost
- Deep Convolutional neural networks

There are some types of machine learning algorithms [1, 3], it may be a good ideia to divide the algorithms by these types:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforced Learning
- Deep Learning
